## Main Steps

### 1. [Getting Started](plan/00-Getting-Started.md)
Use this to clarify your goals, build a writing habit, and set your mindset for the journey. Complete this before writing anything. It helps align your motivation with your plan.

### 2. [Idea Development](plan/01-Idea-Development.md)
Start here after completing your mindset and goals. Use this to brainstorm and combine ideas using the "Idea Salad" approach. You'll also develop your story's one-sentence pitch.

### 3. [Worldbuilding](plan/02-Worldbuilding.md)
Use once you have a rough concept. Begin outlining the setting, society, magic/technology, and geography using Sandersonâ€™s Iceberg Method and Three Laws of Magic. Revisit this throughout drafting.

### 4. [Character Creation](plan/03-Characters.md)
Fill this out alongside worldbuilding and before outlining plot. Define your protagonist, supporting characters, and character arcs. Vital for emotionally resonant storytelling.

### 5. [Plotting](plan/04-Plotting.md)
Use this after your characters and world are defined. Choose a structure (e.g., Three Act or Promise-Progress-Payoff), sketch major beats, and outline character arcs within the plot.

### 6. [Writing the First Draft](plan/05-First-Draft.md)
Begin only after the plot is outlined. Use this file to track your writing goals, scene progress, and keep a daily/weekly writing pace. Accept imperfection.

### 7. [Revision Process](plan/06-Revisions.md)
Use after finishing the first draft. Work through structural, line, and proofreading passes. Includes beta reader questions and polish tips for each pass.

### 8. [Publishing Strategy](plan/07-Publishing-Plan.md)
Use after final revisions. Decide between traditional and indie publishing. Checklist includes query letters, editors, platform setup, and launch prep.
