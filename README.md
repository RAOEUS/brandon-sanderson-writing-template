# Brandon Sanderson-Inspired Novel Writing Template

This project template walks you through the professional novel writing process using Brandon Sanderson's methods, including worldbuilding, character arcs, plotting, drafting, and revision.

## Main Steps

### 1. [Getting Started](plan/00-Getting-Started.md)
Use this to clarify your goals, build a writing habit, and set your mindset for the journey. Complete this before writing anything. It helps align your motivation with your plan.

### 2. [Idea Development](plan/01-Idea-Development.md)
Start here after completing your mindset and goals. Use this to brainstorm and combine ideas using the "Idea Salad" approach. You'll also develop your story's one-sentence pitch.

### 3. [Worldbuilding](plan/02-Worldbuilding.md)
Use once you have a rough concept. Begin outlining the setting, society, magic/technology, and geography using Sandersonâ€™s Iceberg Method and Three Laws of Magic. Revisit this throughout drafting.

### 4. [Character Creation](plan/03-Characters.md)
Fill this out alongside worldbuilding and before outlining plot. Define your protagonist, supporting characters, and character arcs. Vital for emotionally resonant storytelling.

### 5. [Plotting](plan/04-Plotting.md)
Use this after your characters and world are defined. Choose a structure (e.g., Three Act or Promise-Progress-Payoff), sketch major beats, and outline character arcs within the plot.

### 6. [Writing the First Draft](plan/05-First-Draft.md)
Begin only after the plot is outlined. Use this file to track your writing goals, scene progress, and keep a daily/weekly writing pace. Accept imperfection.

### 7. [Revision Process](plan/06-Revisions.md)
Use after finishing the first draft. Work through structural, line, and proofreading passes. Includes beta reader questions and polish tips for each pass.

### 8. [Publishing Strategy](plan/07-Publishing-Plan.md)
Use after final revisions. Decide between traditional and indie publishing. Checklist includes query letters, editors, platform setup, and launch prep.

Each file includes checklists, examples, and worksheets to guide you through each stage of novel development.
